# Coordinator handoff — Dhamma research follow-on campaign (single-source rollout + cleanup)

*Living doc. The coordinator's state. A successor reads this in full, then the files in §2, runs the §4
verification, then executes the §5 queue. Update IN PLACE as items land (snapshot, not append log).
Created 2026-06-22. NOT to be confused with `research/COORDINATOR-HANDOFF.md` (a different program, the
Auditable Translation study) or `research/individual-guidance/COORDINATOR-HANDOFF.md` (the COMPLETED "From
Function to Essence" campaign, whose §3 ledger records everything that already shipped).*

## 0. REFRAME (2026-06-22) — READ THIS, IT SUPERSEDES THE SINGLE-SOURCE FRAMING BELOW
The operator clarified the goal. **There is no PDF deliverable. The live website page (the "reader") is the
ONLY deliverable** (a PDF-export button is a maybe-later, deprioritized). The original ITEM-A premise — "edit
the MD once, regenerate the reader" — rested on a false assumption for the four un-IG studies: their deployed
reader is NOT the same prose as their `FINDINGS-readable.md`; it is a separate, often condensed/differently-
cited write-up (paper-sync drift 148–584 sentences; only IG round-trips EQUIVALENT, having been hand-reconciled
last session). Proof: `node research/individual-guidance/gen-narrative.mjs --check` → EQUIVALENT both regions.

**New job = additive completeness merge, per study.** Make each live page the MOST COMPLETE version, LOSING NO
content: where the disk paper has substantive research the page compresses or omits, fold it into the page (in
the page's house voice — no first person / no em-dash / no "load-bearing"/"cross-cutting"; every new `<Cite>`
must curl 200); where the page has content the paper lacks (e.g. HeartBase modern-practice), keep it. KEEP the
page's live data-bound abstract / aidPanels / census tables / drill-downs. The MD/single-source generator is
now SECONDARY (optional future tidy); do NOT run gen-narrative over a non-IG study (it would replace the page
with the long paper, freeze live counts, and break on MD furniture). **IG is correct — do not touch it.**

Diagnosis pattern observed: most readers state the "assumed/posited, never *verified*" CONCLUSION but COMPRESS
the evidence for it. Diagnose each study first; merge only what's genuinely missing; some readers are already
complete (leave them, like IG).

### Status (2026-06-22, this session)
- **HeartBase — DONE, deployed, pushed (113d96e).** Folded in §IV verification-register near-miss analysis
  (the study's central "posited not verified" argument, previously one sentence) + the limits paragraph; 3 new
  Cites resolve (cst-e0301n.nrf-010, cst-abh08t.nrf-96_p019, cst-abh09t.nrf-237_p002). Modern-practice + census
  untouched.
- **Uttarakuru — DONE, deployed, pushed (34c03dc).** Folded in §V divine-eye "measured zero" evidence (124
  uses, object always rebirth-by-kamma, five near-miss rows 5,000–200,000 chars apart) behind the page's
  existing "verified column is empty" claim. Plain-text cites (page style); no new Cite ids.
- **Naga — ALREADY COMPLETE, no change.** Reader covers §5/§6/§7 fully (abhabba reason, disguise 2→5, down-to-
  Sakka, the H0/H1 cell split, modern reading). FINDINGS.md-vs-SPINE wrinkle moot. Leave it.
- **Awakening — DONE, deployed, pushed (7eb4389).** Reader walked the strata + census but had no closing
  interpretation; folded in MD §VIII (the "mostly a late/devotional layer" payoff + five scholarly limits) as a
  new "What this means, and what it does not" section before the census. Live data-bindings preserved
  (`{fmt(colTotals.mula)}`, early-floor + recollection counts via `data.v2`); no new Cite ids.

### ITEM A COMPLETE (2026-06-22)
All four assessed: HeartBase + Uttarakuru + Awakening got additive completeness merges (deployed); Naga was
already complete (left, like IG). Each live page now carries the most complete version of its research, lost
no content, kept its live data tables. Verification per study: `npm run build` green, every `<Cite>` curls 200,
no em-dash/first-person/"load-bearing"/"cross-cutting" in the touched regions, deploy smoke green
(passages 194710, ready/root 200, research 401). Commits: 113d96e (HeartBase), 34c03dc (Uttarakuru),
7eb4389 (Awakening), plus 959c450 (this doc). NOTE: the disk `FINDINGS-readable.md` / `FINDINGS.md` files are
now SECONDARY drafts, no longer in sync with the canonical live pages (they keep first-person + apparatus the
pages drop, and lack the pages' own additions e.g. HeartBase modern-practice). If a future PDF-export wants a
paper, regenerate it FROM the page, not the stale MD. ITEM B (de-AI scrub of residual first-person in the
non-IG studies) is partly absorbed: the regions touched this pass are already house-voice; untouched regions of
those studies may still carry residual first-person (the original ITEM-B concern).

## 1. Mission
The IG study cleanup (ITEMs 1-3) and a 10-item skill/tool/DB improvement pass are DONE, deployed, and live at
https://dhamma.fly.dev. This campaign is the OPEN follow-ons: chiefly **roll the new MD→JSX single-source
generator over the other narrative studies** so each paper is edited once (in its readable MD) and the
deployed reader is regenerated; plus a few smaller logged follow-ons (§5 ITEM B). All work on `master`,
single working tree, deploy + smoke per change.

## 2. File / artifact map (READ FIRST, in this order)
- **This doc.**
- `research/individual-guidance/COORDINATOR-HANDOFF.md` — the completed campaign's §3 ledger (what shipped:
  the gated cosmology census, the pli-kn de-bucket, the reconciliations/G2/G3/de-comma, then the 10 tool/DB/
  skill improvements). Background only.
- `research/PAPER-SOURCE.md` — **the rollover playbook.** How the IG narrative is single-sourced and exactly
  how to convert the next study. Read this BEFORE touching any reader.
- `research/individual-guidance/gen-narrative.mjs` — the working generator (currently IG-specific: the MD path
  and `IndividualGuidanceStudy` markers are hard-coded). The rollover either parameterizes this (MD-path +
  component + region boundaries as args) or clones it per study.
- `research/paper-sync-check.mjs` — the MD↔JSX drift checker (`node … <md> <Component>`); an eyeball aid for
  the not-yet-converted studies and for catching drift in any study's out-of-scope (hand-JSX) regions.
- The rollover targets (each = a readable MD + a JSX narrative component in `src/ResearchView.jsx`):
  - `research/awakening/FINDINGS-readable.md` → `AwakeningStudy`
  - `research/heart-base/FINDINGS-readable.md` → `HeartBaseStudy`
  - `research/uttarakuru/FINDINGS-readable.md` → `UttarakuruStudy`
  - `research/naga/` → `NagaStudy` — **WRINKLE:** naga's readable is `FINDINGS.md` / `SPINE-FINDINGS.md`, not
    `FINDINGS-readable.md`; confirm which is canonical before converting.
  - DONE: `IndividualGuidanceStudy` ← `research/individual-guidance/FINDINGS-readable.md`. NOT candidates:
    `research/intoxicants/FINDINGS-readable.md` has NO JSX study component; `ArticleStudy`/`ExplorationStudy`
    are generic renderers, not single-study narratives.
- DB research primitives (added this pass — USE them, don't re-derive): `server/sql/schema.sql` defines
  `stratum(work_slug)` (the fine 6-stratum code) + the `is_primary` de-dup flag;
  `scripts/ingest/migrate-stratum-flags.sql` populates them; `research/individual-guidance/{KN-STRATUM-MAP.json,
  KN-REBUCKET.md}` + `RECONCILIATION.md` carry the reasoning.
- Skill (method + writing gates): `.claude/skills/dhamma-research/{SKILL.md, PROVENANCE-SIGNATURE.md (RUNG 5 =
  the SC+CST double-ingest counting hazard), WRITING-STANDARD-READABILITY.md, EDITOR-CHECKLIST.md}`.
- Serial-DB runner: `research/naga/sql.py` — self-extracts the DSN now, so `python research/naga/sql.py "SQL"`
  works with `DATABASE_URL` unset (or export it once for many queries). Proxy must be up:
  `flyctl proxy 15432:5432 --app dhamma-pg` (note the explicit `:5432`).
- Relevant memory notes: `dhamma-concurrency-wedge` (the serial-DB rule + the no-agent-DB-access lesson + F6),
  `writing-rules-from-ig-notes` (the editorial rules; the other 4 studies carry residual load-bearing/
  first-person), `readable-paper-standard`, `dhamma-research-standard`.

## 3. Sub-chat ledger
(none yet — populate as you delegate. NOTE §7: the 4 conversions all edit the SHARED `src/ResearchView.jsx`,
so they are SERIAL, not parallel — last-write-wins would clobber. Prefer ONE long-queue worker doing all four
in order.)

## 4. Verification commands + EXPECTED outputs
- `curl -s https://dhamma.fly.dev/api/dbcheck` → `passages: 194710, pgvector: true`.
- `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' https://dhamma.fly.dev/api/research` → `401` (admin-gated, expected).
- `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' https://dhamma.fly.dev/` → `200`; `…/api/ready` → `200`.
- `npm run build` → `✓ built` (must be green before any deploy).
- DB primitives live:
  `python research/naga/sql.py "SELECT stratum('pli-an') AS s, (SELECT count(*) FILTER (WHERE is_primary) FROM passages) AS prim;"`
  → `1early`, `192945`.
- Per converted study: `npm run build`; `node research/paper-sync-check.mjs research/<x>/FINDINGS-readable.md <Component>`
  (drift should fall to the out-of-scope parts only — method-in-brief / footer / repro-details / data tables);
  curl every `<Cite>` id in the regenerated narrative for `200`.

## 5. Open queue
**ITEM A — roll single-source over AwakeningStudy / HeartBaseStudy / UttarakuruStudy / NagaStudy.**
GOAL: each narrative edited once in its MD; reader regenerated from it; deployed. METHOD (per `PAPER-SOURCE.md`,
following the IG worked example exactly): (1) generalize `gen-narrative.mjs` to take (MD-path, component,
marker boundaries) as args; (2) per study, wire the `GEN:NARRATIVE-A/B` markers around the narrative regions,
leaving data-bound tables / `<details>` OUTSIDE; (3) regenerate; (4) build; (5) `paper-sync-check` → drift =
out-of-scope-only; (6) curl every citation; (7) commit the MD + ResearchView.jsx together; (8) deploy + smoke.
EXPECT: the first regen of each study FIXES its accumulated MD↔JSX drift (as IG's did) — review that diff so
the changes are MD-canonical, not generator bugs. STOP WHEN: all four converted, each verified + deployed.
(Do NagaStudy last, after resolving its readable-file wrinkle, §2.)

**ITEM B — smaller logged follow-ons** (lower priority; each short, self-contained):
- Residual **load-bearing / first-person** prose in the other four studies (the IG study is clean; the others
  carry it per `writing-rules-from-ig-notes`). A de-AI editor pass per study against EDITOR-CHECKLIST.
- The **within-stratum SC+CST double-encoding** caveat: early-stratum row counts run ~2x (recorded in
  `research/individual-guidance/COSMOLOGY-CENSUS.md` + skill RUNG 5). A worked datum, not a defect — surface it
  where any study cites raw early magnitudes, or filter those counts with `WHERE is_primary`.
- **F6 residual:** only the Meaning path is concurrency-capped (`server/src/concurrency.js`,
  `SEARCH_HEAVY_CONCURRENCY=2`); an Exact/Stem burst is theoretically ungated (untested). Extend only if it
  ever proves a real concern.

## 6. Standing principles / decisions (non-negotiable)
- **Serial DB only.** dhamma-pg crashes under concurrent load (the wedge) and cannot self-recover well. NEVER
  fan agents at the DB — they WILL extract the DSN and fire concurrent queries and wedge it (observed this
  campaign; recovery = `pg_terminate_backend` on stale `pg_stat_activity` rows). Agents REASON over inlined
  data; the coordinator runs queries serially via the proxy + `sql.py`, never the live `/api`. See the
  `dhamma-concurrency-wedge` memory.
- **MD is the canonical single-source for a converted study.** Edit the MD, run the generator, build, commit
  the MD + ResearchView.jsx together. NEVER hand-edit a generated `GEN:NARRATIVE` region (it gets overwritten).
- **Writing gates** (EDITOR-CHECKLIST + WRITING-STANDARD): no em-dashes, no first person, no "load-bearing"/
  "cross-cutting", no setup-and-payoff cadence, tendency-not-law, every citation resolves.
- **Commit per item; push to master (project pattern); deploy + smoke after any prose/render change.** Gitignore
  scratch (`research/individual-guidance/_*`, `server/_*`, `*.jsonl`).
- The operator reads the deployed reader; a render change must build green + verify (citations 200, paper-sync)
  before deploy.

## 7. Coordination / ownership
Single working tree on master. The four ITEM-A conversions ALL edit `src/ResearchView.jsx` (shared file) →
**not parallelizable** (last-write-wins clobber, and they race on the shared file + this doc). Run SERIALLY:
one long-queue chat through all four, or strictly one study at a time. The studies' MDs are disjoint but the
reader file is the bottleneck; git-worktree+merge overhead isn't worth it for a shared component. ITEM B's
writing passes touch the same files, so sequence them after each study's ITEM-A conversion (or after all of A).

## 8. Per-pending-item: what to check when it lands
- ITEM A (per study): `GEN:NARRATIVE-A/B` markers bound exactly the narrative (data-bound tables/`<details>`
  OUTSIDE); `npm run build` green; `paper-sync-check` drift = out-of-scope-only; every `<Cite>` id curls 200;
  the regenerated narrative matches the canonical MD (review the diff — it should fix prior drift, not garble);
  deployed + smoke green; the commit is MD + ResearchView.jsx together.
- ITEM B: a grep of the converted paper shows no first-person / "load-bearing" / "cross-cutting"; raw early
  magnitudes carry the double-encoding caveat or are `is_primary`-filtered; build + smoke green.
